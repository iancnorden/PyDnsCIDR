# PyDnsCider

This script dynamically handles CIDR ranges for reverse name looksups from PTR records and spits out results. Properly handles no PTR records exists as well.

### Enhancement Ideas for Later

- Dynamically set DNS servers
- Dynamically set A / CNAME / TXT records as well.
- Output to .csv option
